# Performance-Analysis-with-Different-Cost-Functions-Optimization-Algorithms-and-Features-Data
This was a graduate level personal course project of Optimization for Machine Learning course in University of Victoria. I compared the performance of optimization algorithms in different cost functions, optimization algorithms and feature of input data.

**Report.pdf**: The final report of this project. This report states full detail from background introduction, problem formulation, solution methods, simulations, results, conclusion, and references.
